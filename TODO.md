# TODO

## process command line arguments:
* -f file
* -t filetype
* if filetype is missing guessing the type
* -color calls color to greyscale

## use all three libraries to load pix to memory

## make a common interface for them (a base class) what hides the differences between the separate loaders so you can use the same function names for all the picture types.

## convert to ASCII using the gray-scale method 

## put together a string as a return parameter with the ASCII art inside

## converts to grayscale
